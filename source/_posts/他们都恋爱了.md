我的好朋友们都恋爱了，也许在这很早之前就已经开始了，然而现在才突然感到就我自己一人单身着。同事们很多都已经结婚了。

这一棵lemon tree， 可是不要问我为何还单身。

    I'm sitting here in a boring noon
    It's just another rainy sunday afternoon
    I'm wasting my time
    I get nothing to do
    I'm hanging around 
    And I'm waiting for you
    But nothing have happened and I wonder 

    I'm driving a run in my car
    I'm driving too fast 
    And I'm driving too far
    I'd like to change my point of view
    I feel so lonely 
    I'm waiting for you
    But nothing have happened and I wonder

    I wonder how,I wonder why
    Yesterday you tell me about the bule blue sky
    And all that I can see 
    It's just a yellow lemon tree
    I'm turning my head up and down
    I'm turning,turning,turning,turning, turning around
    And all that I can see 
    It's just another lemon tree

    I'm sitting here and I miss the power
    I'd like to go out taking a shower
    but there is a heavy cloud inside my head
    I feel so tired 
    I put myself to bed
    but nothing have happened and I wonder 

    Isolation,it's not good for me
    Isolation,I don't want to sit on the lemon tree
    I'm stepping around in the desert of joy
    Baby,anyhow I gain another toy
    and everything will happen and you wonder

    I wonder how,I wonder why
    Yesterday you tell me about the bule blue sky
    and all that I can see 
    It's just a yellow lemon tree
    I'm turning my head up and down
    I'm turning,turning,turning,turning, turning around
    and all that I can see 
    It's just yellow lemon tree
    I wonder how,I wonder why
    Yesterday you tell me about the bule blue sky
    and all that I can see 
    It's just a yellow lemon tree.
