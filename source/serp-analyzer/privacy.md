The Privacy Policy describes how we treat personal information when you use our products and services, including information provided when you use the browser extension ('extension'). In addition, the following describes our privacy practices that are specific to the extension.

No personal data will be transmitted or stored. However, extension handles user's settings only to analyze trends for how extension are used.


## Basic features

Any time you use the extension to analyze a website, the extension sends basic, limited information including the domain name of the website you have visited and what application was identified on it. This data is retained in our server logs and protected according to our general Privacy Policy. At no time can this data be traced back to you personally, since no personally identifiable information is stored.


## Data collected by our browser addons, extensions and apps

### Data collected

You do not need to provide any personal information in order to download and use the extension. All of the features can be used without sharing any personally identifiable information.

Our browser addons, extensions and apps (hereafter called "addon") do not embed any kind of tracking or analytic code. All the information displayed by the addon is collected by our service. The addon sends a request to our service for information. Your IP address, internet browser and timestamp will be logged for every request. We only use this information to protect our service for abuse. These logs are removed after 180 days. Depending on the function of the addon this request may include the hostname part of the current URL. The first time we detect a new hostname it will be added to our database of hostnames and used to deliver our tools and services. Collected hostname data is always stored without any user context or reference to personally identifiable information.

## Your choices

Any feature that works by automatically sending information about sites when you visit them can be disabled and re-enabled in the extension settings.
